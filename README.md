## Status

**`Work In progress`**
> *A routing rework is underway for reliability - May 2024*

## About
<!-- DESCRIPTION START -->
This is the PCB repository for the 2040Macro Project, 


Please refer to the [parent repository](https://github.com/LeHuman/2040Macro)
<!-- DESCRIPTION END -->

## Usage

This project is made in Altium, but will be converted, where possible, to a KiCad project once this project is finalized. Otherwise, look at the release page for gerber files which can be directly sent to a PCB manufacturer.

### Requirements

- [Altium](https://www.altium.com/) >= 24.0.0

## PCB Gallery

### v1.6.0

![2040Macro-v0.4.1](Images/PCB/2040Macro-v0.4.1.png) \
*Version 1.6.0 of the 2040Macro PCB* \
*Current capacity of inner layers are inadequate but manufacturing proved fine.*

### v1.2.0

![2040Macro-v0.3.1](Images/PCB/2040Macro-v0.3.1.png) \
*Version 0.3.1 of the 2040Macro PCB* \
*Critical issue with inner layer trace cause subpar manufacturing, got too confident with trace widths.*
